The Genius Square is a logical puzzle first created by Algerian mathematician Salim Berghiche in 2018. It was redesigned into a board game for two players and manufactured by The Happy Puzzle Company. The premise is simple: At the beginning of the puzzle, 7 dice are thrown which correspond to different squares in a 6x6 grid. Single-square "blockers" are placed on those points and the player must then fit a series of shapes around these blockers, filling up the rest of the space. Each die has between 2 and 6 possible points in can land on, and of course these cannot overlap.

The shapes that are used to cover the rest of the space are called "Polyominoes". The word "Polyomino", first coined by Solomon W. Goulomb during a talk for the Harvard Mathematics Club in 1953, is the name for a shape made of squares which are joined together at the edges. There are a few every-day cases of these: for instance, dominoes are 2 squares joined together.

The board is tiled with exactly one of each type of "free polyomino" of at most order (area) 4. This means that these polyominoes may be reflected and rotated before being placed.

This project explores the usage of Haskell to solve the puzle. As an addition, a hint system may be developed. Enjoy :)
